        Great job! You've finished our course on HTML and CSS - but don't worry, the fun doesn't stop here. In order to
        retain your knowledge, try making your own big project! You can look back through all of our lessons as a
        reference, and use other resources online to your advantage! Make anything you want - even a website like this
        one that teaches beginners how to code HTML and CSS! However, make sure you <strong>keep your project
        organised.</strong> This will help immensely to keep track of all of your images, stylesheets, and HTML easily,
        and prevent the confusion that comes from messy projects! Once again, good job finishing our course and have
        fun out in the World Wide Web!
