        <p>
            At the moment, our website looks a little bland... why don't we add a image to spice things up? To do this,
            we add a <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to our HTML - however, that's not all we need. We can't just expect
            the browser to know exactly <em>what</em> image we're talking about. We need to add an
            <strong>attribute</strong> to our <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. There are lots of different attributes that
            we can use for different tags, but at the moment we are only going to talk about the <code>src</code>
            attribute for the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The <code>src</code> attribute tells the
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag what image to actually display. We write it like this:<br/><br/>

            <code>&lt;img src="path_to_image" &gt;</code><br/><br/>

            Essentially, attributes simply give elements more information to use. Before we go any further, it would be
            a good time to talk about <strong>directories</strong>.<br/><br/>

            Directories tell the browser, or computer, where it can find a specific file. For example, if you were
            looking for your documents folder on Windows, it's likely to be in the directory
            <code>C:\Users\username\Documents\</code>. On UNIX based systems (Mac, Linux, etc) it's likely to be in the
            directory <code>/Users/username/Documents/</code>, which can also be written as <code>~/Documents/</code>
            (the <code>~</code> symbol means your user folder in UNIX environments). As you can see, there are some
            differences between the two. The most obvious is that Windows uses backslashes (<code>\</code>) and UNIX
            uses forward slashes (<code>/</code>). Another difference is that Windows denotes what disk drive the
            computer should look on with the letter and the colon at the beginning of the path (<code>C:\</code>).
            The CGSComputing web server runs on a Linux based system, so it uses the UNIX type directory. This is what
            you will use to point to images and other resources in your HTML.<br/><br/>

            Let's say, in your root directory (usually the folder <code>/</code>)  you have a folder called "images".
            Inside that folder you have a picture, say for example, <code>meme.png</code>. We want to get that meme so
            it displays on our website. To do this, in our HTML file which will also be in the root directory, we'll
            put a <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with a source attribute that <strong>points</strong> to the image. If we
            use a directory source that doesn't have a <code>/</code> in front of it, it's called a
            <strong>relative</strong> directory. This is because it points to a folder <em>from</em> the directory the
            HTML file is currently in - e.g. in our case, we would write <code>&lt;img src="images/meme.png" &gt;</code>
            or if the HTML file was in another folder called HTML, we would write
            <code>&lt;img src="../images/meme.png" &gt;</code>. The <code>../</code> means that you go
            <strong>back</strong> in a directory, like pressing the back button in your file browser. If, however, the
            src attribute <strong>does</strong> have a <code>/</code> in front of it, it's called an
            <strong>absolute</strong> directory. This means instead of pointing to a directory from the HTML file, it
            points to it from the root directory.<br/><br/>

            Now it's your turn - right click in your directory tree in ShiftEdit, create a new folder called
            "pictures", and then right click on that new folder you just made and upload any image from your computer
            that you would like to display on your website, and make a image tag in your HTML that you already have
            from the previous lessons that will display that image - put your image between the heading and the
            paragraph.
