    <p>
        Classes and IDs, which you have heard about before, are very important. Say if we want to style one specific
        paragraph in our HTML, but not all of them? We would use a <strong>class</strong> or an <strong>id</strong> to
        do this.<br/><br/>

        Classes and IDs are essentially the same, except with one key difference. Classes can be used over and over
        again on many different elements, however IDs can only be used on <strong>one</strong> element. To set a class
        or ID, go to the element you want to add a class/id to, then add an attribute, either <code>class</code> or
        <code>id</code>, then set it to whatever you want. An example is down below:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;p class="redText"&gt;Look! I'm red!&lt;/p&gt;</code><br/><br/>

        Now, we can style that specific class using a slightly different syntax, but it is still very similar.
    </p>
    <code class="blockCentered">
        .redText {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br/>
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        Notice that we use the "." dot in front of the class name - if we are styling an ID, we use a "#" hash in front
        of the name.<br/><br/>

        Classes and IDs are extremely useful, and you can make amazing looking websites with navigation bars, side
        bars, plus so much more. This is where <strong>Divs and spans</strong> are also very powerful - apply a class
        to a div and you could style an entire section green, if you want! As you will find out in the future, if you
        continue developing for web, you will be using classes and IDs almost constantly!
