    <p>
        Now, let's start styling the web page you currently have! There are 3 ways of styling a HTML document:
        <strong>inline</strong>, <strong>internal</strong> and <strong>external</strong>. To show the differences,
        let's make the paragraph in our website that we already have's font colour to be red. To do this, we use the
        property <code>color</code>. This simply defines the font's color, and we can do this using a
        <strong>hexadecimal</strong> value, an <strong>RGB</strong> value, or one of the already built in colours that
        CSS provides for us, like <code>blue</code> or <code>pink</code> (see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors</a> for more). Note
        that all CSS properties are spelt using the American spelling, so <code>colour</code> (with a "u") will not
        work.<br/><br/>

        The <strong>inline</strong> way to style elements is as follows:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;</code><br/><br/>

        We use the <strong>style</strong> attribute in our HTML element to directly affect just that tag without using
        a selector. In this case, I have used the RGB style of a pure red colour. This way of styling is easy and
        simple, though it can get messy easily and it makes it difficult to use multiple properties. For
        <strong>internal</strong> styling, we use the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag inside the
        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our HTML:
    </p>
    <code class="blockCentered">
        &lt;style&gt;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: #FF0000;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
        &lt;/style&gt;<br/>
    </code>
    <p>
        In this case, the CSS is in the same file as all our HTML. I've used the hexadecimal style of indicating a pure
        red colour. This method makes it easier to read our CSS and add multiple styles, however both style and
        structure is in the same document, which is not the best way to go about doing things, especially when working
        with multiple documents, as you will have to copy and past the same style in all your different HTML documents!
        <strong>External</strong> styling is the solution to this. All we do is <strong>link</strong> a CSS file to our
        HTML using, coincidentally, a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. This means we can use the same CSS file with
        multiple HTML files with ease, and further separate our style from our structure:<br/><br/>

        In our HTML we have:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;link href="path_to_css_file" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</code><br/><br/>

        <code>href</code> tells where the CSS file is, <code>rel</code> tells the browser how the linked file
        <em>relates</em> to the HTML, and <code>type</code> tells the browser what <em>kind</em> of file is
        linked.<br/><br/>

        Create a CSS file (with the extension .css) somewhere, but remember to keep your project organised! Our
        recommendation is to create the style sheet inside a folder called "css" or similar in your root directory. Add
        the link tag like above, except with the correct <code>href</code> value, and put the following code in your
        newly created CSS file:
    </p>
    <code class="blockCentered">
        p {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br/>
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        And reload your page! If you have successfully done this, your "Hello, World!" paragraph should be red! Well
        done - that was your first taste into CSS styling.
