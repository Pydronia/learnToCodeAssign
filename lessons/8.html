        Before we enter the CSS portion of the course, it would be good to learn about 2 other HTML tags that will be
        used extensively throughout your time developing for web.<br/><br/>

        Every single element you have used in HTML is either a <strong>block</strong> element, or an
        <strong>inline</strong> element. Block elements are arranged down the page - e.g. 2 block elements, one after
        each other, will be arranged one below the other. Essentially, they always start on a new line. Examples of
        these are <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph elements, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>
        headings, and tables. Inline elements usually affect text <em>inside</em> block elements - they might change
        the style of some text, and don't have to begin on a new line. Examples of inline elements include
        <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, and images. One main point to keep in mind is that block
        elements can have both block elements <em>and</em> inline elements inside them, but inline elements can only
        have other inline elements in them - it's bad practice to have a block element inside a inline element.<br/>
        <br/>

        The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is a <strong>dummy</strong> block element. This means it applies no
        styling to content inside whatsoever by default. It is simply a way to break up an entire section of HTML into
        divisions, and to style those specific divisions using classes and ID's (which is a part of CSS, to be
        introduced in later lessons. This is the same with the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element. This is a dummy
        <em>inline</em> element, as compared to the block element <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. It does nothing but provide
        structure to the web page and a means of styling individual parts of text.<br/><br/>

        This concludes the HTML portion of the course. In the next lesson, you will begin to learn CSS and how to style
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>'s properly to make beautiful looking websites!
