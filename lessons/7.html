    <p>
        Now, what if we want more than one web page on our website, or to make a link to other websites that aren't
        ours? To do this, we use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or <strong>anchor</strong> tag. This simply creates a
        link that the user can click on to send their browser to another web page. The format of an anchor tag is as
        follows:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;a src="url"&gt;Text to be linked&lt;/a&gt;</code>

        With this, we can link to any other HTML document in our web server via a directory (see the lesson "Images and
        Directories") or via a direct URL. If we wanted some text that said "Go to Google" which, when clicked on,
        would send the browser to Google, we would have an anchor tag as follows:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;a src="http://google.com.au"&gt;Go to Google&lt;/a&gt;</code>

        As an exercise, create a new HTML document wherever you want, make sure it validates, have whatever you want in
        it and create a link to that new HTML document on your main web page, which is the one with the table and the
        meme. Using proper organisation, you can create complex multi-page websites with ease!
