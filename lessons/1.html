        <p>
            Lets start with the absolute basics - how does the Internet actually <em>work?</em> Computers that are
            connected to the internet either servers, or clients. <strong>Clients</strong> are the "normal" users of the internet -
            people like you who browse the web using <em>web browsers</em> (which we will come to in a minute) on a
            laptop, a desktop, or even a smartphone.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Servers</strong>, on the other hand, are where all the information on the internet are stored. When
            a client wants to visit a website, say, Google for example, the client sends a request to the server asking
            for a particular webpage. The server then <em>returns</em> this webpage back to the client - and usually this is a
            <strong>HTML file.</strong><br/><br/>

            HTML is the most commonly used coding language for webpages. HTML stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup
            Language</strong> and is used for over one billion websites worldwide. Browsers such as Firefox, Chrome and
            Safari are all programs which read HTML code and interpret them so that we humans can easily read and view
            webpages, without having to decipher messy code! Below is a helpful diagram to help explain this process.
