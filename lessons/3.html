        </code>
        <p>
            Above, you can see an example of a fully functioning web page - let's go through the features of it before
            letting you make your own!<br/><br/>

            Things inside angular brackets (&lt;&gt;) are called tags - or elements. They tell the browser how to structure
            your content. There are many different tags that affect the structure of your content: some
            examples follow.<br/><br/>

            An example of an opening paragraph element tag would be <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and an example of a closing
            tag would be <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Using a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the most common way to put text
            into your website.<br/><br/>

            Other tags that affect text include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>: Tells the browser to <em>emphasise</em> the text. Most browsers simply make it
                italic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>: Tells the browser to make the text <strong>strong</strong>, usually making
                it bold.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>: This defines a heading - there are 6 types, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and so on, all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>.
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the biggest heading, and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> the smallest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now, what is that <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tag at the top? This is a tag that doesn't need to be
            closed (that is, have another tag with a slash in front of it) that tells the browser what <em>type</em> of
            document the browser is looking at - in this case it's <code>html</code>, so the browser will show the
            web page like it should, as HTML.<br/><br/>

            What about those <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags?
            Put simply, you always have to put the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag around everything in your web page.
            We always need it, as it represents the root of the HTML document. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag is
            where you put the title of your web page plus other information about it, as well as linking CSS
            stylesheets to it (which we will get to in later lessons)! The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag is essentially
            where you put all the content you want to see on the screen - you should not put any content outside of it!
            <br/><br/>

            Now, try making your own web site! Use the code above as reference, however make it so it has a title that
            says "Hello, World!", a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading that says "My first website!" and a
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph that also says "Hello, World!" Check your website by going to the address
            of the new HTML document you have made, and then check your code with the solution below
            when you have done!<br/><br/>

            <strong>Hint:</strong> Right click in the directory tree to the left of ShiftEdit and create a new HTML
            document to start, then go to <strong>cgscomputing.com/studentid/name_of_html_document.html</strong> to see
            your website. If you name your file "index.html", your browser will automatically show that page if you go
            to <strong>cgscomputing.com/studentid/</strong>.<br/>
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Solution</h1>
        <code class="blockCentered">
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
            &lt;html&gt;<br />
            &lt;head&gt;<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;<br />
            &lt;/head&gt;<br />
            &lt;body&gt;<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;My first website!&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/body&gt;<br />
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            If you got this, or something similar to this, good job! In HTML, spaces and new lines outside of tags
            don't matter at all - however we use <strong>indentation</strong> to make it readable for other fellow
            coders. This involves using tabs on tags and content that are <strong>nested</strong> (inside) another tag.
            The indentation above is a good idea of how your code should look.
