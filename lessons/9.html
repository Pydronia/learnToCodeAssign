    <p>
        <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong> (CSS) is the name for the coding language used to add visuals and style
        to your HTML, with color, graphics, animations, positioning, and more. CSS was introduced in December 17, 1996
        and was developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, Bert Bos and the World Wide Web Consortium. Being a separate language, it
        keeps style (CSS) and structure (HTML) separate, which makes it easy to make distinctions between the actual
        meaning of a document, and how that meaning is presented to your viewers. This is also good as it assists with
        machine readability, or how easily the browser can interpret your document. Below is an example of some CSS,
        and its structure:
    </p>
    <code class="blockCentered">
        p {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br/>
        }<br/><br/>

        selector {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property: value;<br/>
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        Let's break this down. The <strong>selector</strong> is what we actually want to style - it could be an
        element, a class, or an ID, of which the latter two we will learn about later. So, if we want to style all the
        <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s in our HTML, we would use "h2" as our selector. After the selector we must have our
        <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>values</strong> inside curly braces ({}). A property is the specific
        aspect about the selector that we want to change - it could be the text color, the size of the font, the type
        of font, or much much more. After the property we have a colon (:) and the value - this is what we actually
        want the property to be set to, like <em>which</em> text color, or <em>what</em> font size. This
        <strong>statement</strong> always ends in a semicolon (;).<br/><br/>

        Above is essentially what CSS is in a nutshell. In the next lesson we will learn how to actually apply this to
        our HTML.
