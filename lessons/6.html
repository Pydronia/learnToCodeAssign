    <h1 class="heading">Validation</h1>
    <p>
        Websites all have to follow rules to make sure they work properly and look as they should on websites -
        otherwise you can get weird glitches and inconsistencies between different browsers. This is where
        <strong>validation</strong> comes into play. There are many different types and versions of HTMl, however in
        these examples, we will be talking about XHTML 1.0 Strict validation.<br/><br/>

        So far most of the code you have already seen is based on HTML 5, the newest version of HTML. XHTML is a
        version of HTML that has very strict rules about syntax. This is what you must have in every HTML file you want
        to comply with XHTML:
    </p>
    <code class="blockCentered">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;<br />
        &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;<br />
        &lt;head&gt;	<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Conforming XHTML 1.0 Strict Template&lt;/title&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;	<br />
        &lt;/head&gt;<br />
        &lt;body&gt;<br />
        <br />
        &lt;/body&gt;<br />
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
        Note that the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> tag is very different, as well as the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
        tag. There is also a new tag, the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag - don't worry to much about this, but all it
        does is give extra information to the browser about the web page. Try now changing your current webpage to
        conform to XHTML (Hint: Change the DOCTYPE, html, and add the meta tags to match the code above), and validate
        your webpage at <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/</a>, the official HTML validator.
        Bookmark this page - you will find it very useful in the future!<br/><br/>

        You'll find that if you try to validate your website, you'll come up with a few errors. Try and fix these - a
        big problem for most new developers is remembering to put a <code>/</code> at the end of <em>self-closing</em>
        tags, like the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Another thing to note about the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is
        that you will need a <code>alt</code> attribute as well, to validate to XHTML. This stands for "alternative",
        and it is simply the text to display if your image <code>src</code> does not point to a valid image, resulting
        in a broken image. Your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag should now look like:<br/><br/>

        <code>&lt;img src="images/meme.png" alt="Cannot find the meme :(" /&gt;</code><br/><br/>

        Revalidate, and your web page should now comply completely to XHTML 1.0 Strict! If not, try to fix whatever other
        errors the validator shows. (The table may not validate properly, but don't worry about that for now as it
        requires CSS to fix.) Validation is very important to every web developer - it makes sure your code will
        work with new browsers far into the future - even if it looks OK now. Start trying to make all of your websites
        validate - even if the code we show <em>doesn't</em> validate properly. Doing this is great practice, and makes
        sure <strong>100%</strong> that your web page will look and work like you want it too.

    <h1 class="heading">Organisation</h1>
    <p>
        Organisation is important for any big web based project - even this website uses organisation! If you have all
        of your websites, images, stylesheets, and other content all in one folder or even worse, the root directory,
        it makes it very hard to keep track of all of your files. It's great practice to spit up your images, CSS
        (which we will learn about later) and HTML into different folders depending on what they're for. This is most
        useful when working with <strong>multiple pages</strong>, which we will learn about in the next lesson!
